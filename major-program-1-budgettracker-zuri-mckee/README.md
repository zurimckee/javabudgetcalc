**Major Program Workflow:**

-   After accepting the assignment, you need to clone the MP1 repository
    on your local machine. You now have one branch (main branch).

-   You should now create a new branch by clicking "main" in the title
    bar in IntelliJ and selecting new branch. Name your branch Level-1.
    Level-1 should now be your active branch.

-   Make all your Level-1 changes as described in the assignment
    description on this level. Please commit your changes and push them
    to GitHub after each work session to safeguard your work.

-   When Level-1 is done, make sure you have committed and pushed all
    your changes. Go to your repository on the GitHub site and select
    Pull Request. Choose your TA. Your TA will be notified and will look
    over your code. When they are done, your Level-1 branch will be
    merged with your main branch.

-   If you want to start Level-2 before your Level-1 branch has been
    merged, then make sure you branch off of Level-1 for Level-2. If you
    start Level-2 after Level-1 has been merged, then you can branch off
    the main branch.

-   This same procedure will be repeated at each level.
